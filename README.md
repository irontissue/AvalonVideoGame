# AvalonVideoGame

Idea:
Building with time bombs all over the place, which a team of X people must escape by succesfully defusing all the bombs.

Time bombs have a complicated multi-step defuse requirement, requiring a certain number of people to defuse it successfully.

People assume roles similar to those in Avalon.
